class ReactiveScope(MutableMapping):
    """
    A scope that reacts to writes by computing associated functions, themselves writing
    in the scope, creating a chain reaction that propagates information through the
    scope.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func_nodes : Iterable[ReactiveFuncNode]
        The functions that will be called when the scope is written to.
    scope_factory : Callable[[], MutableMapping]
        A factory that returns a new scope. The scope will be cleared by calling this
        factory at each call to `.clear()`.

    Examples
    --------

    First, we need some func nodes to define the reaction relationships.
    We'll stuff these func nodes in a DAG, for ease of use, but it's not necessary.

    >>> from meshed import FuncNode, DAG
    >>>
    >>> def f(a, b):
    ...     return a + b
    >>> def g(a_plus_b, d):
    ...     return a_plus_b * d
    >>> f_node = FuncNode(func=f, out='a_plus_b')
    >>> g_node = FuncNode(func=g, bind={'d': 'b'})
    >>> d = DAG((f_node, g_node))
    >>>
    >>> print(d.dot_digraph_ascii())
    <BLANKLINE>
                  a
    <BLANKLINE>
                │
                │
                ▼
              ┌────────┐
      b   ──▶ │   f    │
              └────────┘
      │         │
      │         │
      │         ▼
      │
      │        a_plus_b
      │
      │         │
      │         │
      │         ▼
      │       ┌────────┐
      └─────▶ │   g_   │
              └────────┘
                │
                │
                ▼
    <BLANKLINE>
                  g
    <BLANKLINE>

    Now we make a scope with these func nodes.

    >>> s = ReactiveScope(d)

    The scope starts empty (by default).

    >>> s
    <ReactiveScope with .scope: {}>

    So if we try to access any key, we'll get a KeyError.

    >>> s['g']  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    KeyError: 'g'

    That's because we didn't put write anything in the scope yet.

    But, if you give ``g_`` enough data to be able to compute ``g`` (namely, if you
    write values of ``b`` and ``a_plus_b``), then ``g`` will automatically be computed.

    >>> s['b'] = 3
    >>> s['a_plus_b'] = 5
    >>> s
    <ReactiveScope with .scope: {'b': 3, 'a_plus_b': 5, 'g': 15}>

    So now we can access ``g``.
    
    >>> s['g']
    15

    Note though, that we first showed that ``g`` appeared in the scope before we
    explicitly asked for it. This was to show that ``g`` was computed as a
    side-effect of writing to the scope, not because we asked for it, triggering the
    computation

    Let's clear the scope and show that by specifying ``a`` and ``b``, we get all the
    other values of the network.

    >>> s.clear()
    >>> s
    <ReactiveScope with .scope: {}>
    >>> s['a'] = 3
    >>> s['b'] = 4
    >>> s
    <ReactiveScope with .scope: {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'a_plus_b': 7, 'g': 28}>
    >>> s['g']  # (3 + 4) * 4 == 7 * 4 == 28
    28
